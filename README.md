Declare a global counter variable.
Create a simple function that increments the variable, and then calls itself recursively.
Surround the initial function call in a try/catch block.
Within the catch, log the error and the value of the counter variable.

// Part 2: Trampolines

Write a recursive function that completely flattens an array of nested arrays, regardless of how deeply nested the arrays are.
Once your recursive function is complete, trampoline it.

// Part 3: Deferred Execution

Create a simple HTML element to hold text. Cache this HTML element into a JavaScript variable.
Write a function that takes a parameter n and adds a list of all prime numbersÂ between one and n to your HTML element.
Once complete, use the alert() method to alert the user that the calculation is finished.
Modify your function such that each number has an opportunity to render after it is calculated, and the alert only appears once all numbers have been rendered.
You may want to make use of recursion, and do not forget about setTimeout(..., 0).
